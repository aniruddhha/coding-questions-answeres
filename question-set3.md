# Basic Questions : Co-Routines and RxKotlin

1. Get Array of 100 integers and perform following operatins in co-routine i.e create 2 couritine jobs one for sort and other for serach perticular number in an array
2. Get Array of 100 integers and perform following operatins in RxKotlin i.e create 2 observables one for sort and other for serach perticular number in an array
3. Write co-routine using launch and async way; which will sort linked list of string[Async](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29802323/android-with-kotlin-how-to-use-httpurlconnection)
4. Write Rxkotlin observable which will sort linked list of string
5. Write a class which will help you in reading, writing and copying file using co-routines. i.e. you will create three seperate jobs. Please try in launch and async way both
6. Write a class which will help you in reading, writing and copying file using RxKotlin Observables. i.e. you will create three seperate observables. 
7. You have to read contents of index page of google; for that you need to study HttpUrlConnection class, use it and print index page data. [Hint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29802323/

10.  Write a code for reading content of google index page after every 2 seconds; Use RxKotlin use interval operator [Question of Stack Overflow is Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54827455/how-to-implement-timer-with-kotlin-coroutines) 
11. There is array of int array `[ [1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6] ]`. By considering this array write a code for explaning usagaes of map and flatMap operator in RxKotlin
